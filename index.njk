			<h3 id="css-first">What Is CSS-first design?</h3>
			<p>
				CSS-first is a method of development that prioritizes content structure. It ensures design
				elements are implemented using CSS as a first pass and then added to any HTML. The CSS 
				for the components should be as unopinionated as possible so as to allow flexability in
				the HTML structure. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The advantages to this are increased flexibility for developers, separation of design and content
				and enhanced accessibility.
			</p>
			<p>
				CSS-first design works best when combined with HTML-first web development.

			<h3 id="what-is-codium">What Is Codium?</h3>
			<p>
				Codium is a design system that that was created using HTML and CSS snippets.
				It is loosely based on 
				<a href="https://niljs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nil.js</a>,
				a project I started a few years ago. The original 
				<a href="https://niljs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nil.js</a> 
				project was intended as a 
				proof of concept to show most common design elements could be built without JavaScript.

			<h3 id="why-codium">Why Codium?</h3>
			<p>
				Many design systems are built on components that require a particular framework.
				Codium uses HTML and CSS snippets. This allows the system to be implemented in 
				any framework.

			<h3 id="not-use-codium">When Should I not Use Codium?</h3>
			<p>
				If you have an existing ecosystem that would not adapt well with using raw CSS
				and HTML for your design system. If you are using a system with little or no
				CSS used for styling and structure.

				Codium works best when developers write in a CSS-first manor, if your team 
				does not have the technical expertise in CSS Codium will be a difficult system to 
				implement.
