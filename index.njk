			<p>
				Codium is a CSS-first design system and snippet based component library
				<a href="https://niljs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nil.js</a>,
				a project I started a few years ago. The original 
				<a href="https://niljs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nil.js</a> 
				project was intended as a 
				proof of concept to show most common design elements could be built without JavaScript.

			<h3 id="css-first">What Is CSS-first design?</h3>
			<p>
				CSS-first is a method of design that prioritizes content structure. It ensures design
				elements are implemented using CSS as a first pass and then added to any HTML. The CSS 
				for the components should be as unopinionated as possible so as to allow flexibility in
				the HTML structure. CSS-first design works best with complimentary HTML-first web development. 
				You can learn about both on my blogs on the topic [link-to-web-first-teams] 
				[link-to-css-first-blog] [link-to-html-first-blog].

			<h3 id="why-codium">Why Codium?</h3>
			<p>
				Codium is CSS-first, the advantages to this are increased flexibility for 
				developers, separation of design and content and enhanced accessibility.
				Combined with HTML-first development, CSS-first design is extraordinarily 
				powerful and results in robust, maintainable code and design components.

			<h3 id="not-use-codium">When Should I not Use Codium?</h3>
			<p>
				Since Codium leverages CSS-first design, if your design team is not built
				around CSS-first, and is not willing to make the change, Codium is probably
				not the ideal choice for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				You will also encounter similar problems if you are building a new design
				with an existing development team that is not ready to make the change to
				HTML-first development.
